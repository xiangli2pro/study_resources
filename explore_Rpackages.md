## Interesting R packages to be explored

1. `r2d3` provides utilities for working with D3 visualisations.

2. `beepr` plays notification sounds.

3. `rDrop` for Dropbox.

4. `available` package has a function called `available()` that helps you evaluate a potential package name from many angles.

5. `renv` (and its predecessor `packrat`) automate the process of [managing project-specific libraries](https://r-pkgs.org/package-structure-state.html ). 

6. Path helpers like `testthat::test_path()`, `fs::path_package()`, and the `rprojroot` package are extremely useful for building resilient paths 
that hold up across the whole range of situations that come up during development and usage.

7. [`withr`](https://withr.r-lib.org/articles/changing-and-restoring-state.html) context manager in R.

8. `httr` download data from website.

9. [`tidyr: hoist(), unnest()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/hoist.html).

10. `lintr` performs automated checks to confirm that you conform to the style guide.

11. `rlang`

12. `Codetools`: function `findGlobals()` locates all global variables used by a function. This can be useful 
if you want to check that your function doesnâ€™t inadvertently rely on variables defined in their parent environment.
`checkUsage()` checks for a range of common problems including unused local variables, unused parameters, and the use of partial argument matching.

13. [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle): a app to create diagrams.
